# On-Station-File-Exporter
Code for exporting legacy On Station Cave Mapping files to Compass and Walls.

I've made as much effort as possible to save any On Station formatting and comments, but I had a limited selection of projects to test with.

If you run into problems, please let me know and I'll update the code.
