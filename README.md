# On-Station-File-Exporter
This code was put together by Taco van Ieperen in 2020. The goal is to make it easy to pull legacy data from On Station into Compass and Walls. I've put a fair bit of effort into preserving as much of the On Station data as possible including comments and folder structure. However, my set of test caves was limited, so no doubt this will require some work.

If you run into any problems, feel free to contact me at tacovan@gmail.com
